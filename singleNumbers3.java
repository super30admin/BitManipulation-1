/*
- Let a and b be the two unique numbers
- XORing all numbers gets you (a xor b)
- (a xor b) must be non-zero otherwise they are equal
- If bit_i in (a xor b) is 1, bit_i at a and b are different.
- Find bit_i using the low bit formula m & -m (2's complement of m)
- Partition the numbers into two groups: one group with bit_i == 1 and the other group with bit_i == 0.
- a is in one group and b is in the other.
- a is the only single number in its group.
- b is also the only single number in its group.
 - XORing all numbers in a's group to get a
- XORing all numbers in b's group to get b
Alternatively, XOR (a xor b) with a gets you b.
